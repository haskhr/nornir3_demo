## Introduction

In this presentation we are going to do a nornir 3 deep dive.

To do so we are going to pretend we have been hired by Acme Corp. and tasked to build the necessary tooling so the network engineering team can easily build their own tooling

## Goals

1. Write an inventory plugin to interact with Acme Inventory System
2. Write a connection plugin and a few taks to interact with AcmeOS
3. Write a few processors to show meaningful information to users and to log custom events to syslog
4. Write a runner that understands Acme's network topology in order to safely deploy changes at scale
5. Write a few functions to show more meaningful information to users
6. Build a POC for a network orchestrator
